**# Employee Database: A Mystery in Two Parts - SQL**

**## EmployeeSQL**

### Data Modeling

In this activity, I will be practicing how to build ERD of the tables given, showing how I can put together the given CSV tables into a relational database form. I have submitted the Entity Relationship Diagram exported from QuickDBD in the EmployeeSQL folder.

### Data Engineering

In this portion of the exercise, I will make a table schema to create tables and specify the needed relationship in terms of PRIMARY KEY and FOREIGN KEY according to the ERD I sketched out earlier. Then I will import the csv tables using PGadmin4 to set up for further analysis.

Data Analysis

Finally, I will writing a query script to query the needed table to collect information for the following questions:

1. List the following details of each employee: employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary.
2. List first name, last name, and hire date for employees who were hired in 1986.
3. List the manager of each department with the following information: department number, department name, the manager's employee number, last name, first name.
4. List the department of each employee with the following information: employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
5. List first name, last name, and sex for employees whose first name is "Hercules" and last names begin with "B."
6. List all employees in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
7. List all employees in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
8. In descending order, list the frequency count of employee last names, i.e., how many employees share each last name.
